# Physics Simulation Engine

This is a project to explore how a basic physics engine works, using SFML and concept like verlet integration to implement basic features like gravity and objects kinematics, collision handling, link constraints.

To give it a go you can go to the *Releases* tab and download the **PhysEng-installer.exe**, which will help you install the application alongiside with an uninstall executable.
